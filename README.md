# WhereIsRain

This is my first project with Angular framework. It's a weather app that uses <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> and <a href="https://locationiq.com/">LocationIQ</a> api to check the current weather in a selected place. Also uses <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">leafletjs</a> map. Application checks the user's location and creates a mark on map that shows the animated weather in a given place.

The left panel shows the moon and the sun (depending on the time of day in the city), clouds (depending on the cloud cover) and simple weather information such as temperature or humidity in selected town.

With each search, the application marks a city with the current weather, so user can check weather in different places and compare it thanks to animated gifs on the map.
